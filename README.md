## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

Learned a bit about how to optimize for phone with percentages instead of using pixels.
Good to practice with margins.

```css
.attribution {
    position:absolute;
    left:50%;
    font-size: 11px; text-align: center;
    margin-top: 5px;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    top: 110%;

}
```

### Continued development

CSS Grid and Flexbox

### Useful resources
